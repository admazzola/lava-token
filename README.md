# Lava Token

EIP 721:
https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/assets/eip-712/Example.js




### Testing



npm install



1. run 'ganache-cli' in another terminal
2. copy account address and pkey into the /test file LavaWallet.js
3. 'npm run test'





TO VERIFY:
1. Had to flatten so libs were inside the one file  
2. Deploy using Remix, it actually deployed two contracts (ecrecovery and lavawallet)
3. Verified ecrecovery by itself
4. Used the new Beta validator with the FULL flat file, point at the ecrecovery lib by address as well
